This small project is academic. It was developed with Native Web Development
Languages. The main goal of the project is to save a student data inside a
Database. The project is subdivided in two parts such as: Front-end and
Back-end. In Front-end, we have two views: register and saved students pages.
Theses pages are using basic HTML and CSS to draw layouts, controls and
JavaScript to make some HTTP requests to Back-end via Node.js. In students
data page, a JavaScript functional component is built to draw each specific
student data with animation effects attached to that. In Back-end, a simple
Node.js API is developed to get and treat client requests. Express.js is used
as a server to run this project. Note that each student data is stored into a
local Database called SQLite. The communication between Front-end and Back-end
uses AJAX and data transfer uses JSON language.
